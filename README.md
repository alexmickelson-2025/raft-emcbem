Test Scenarios Done:

[ ] When a leader is active it sends a heart beat within 50ms.
[ ] When a node receives an AppendEntries from another node, then first node remembers that other node is the current leader.
[X] When a new node is initialized, it should be in follower state.
[X] When a follower doesn't get a message for 300ms then it starts an election.
[X] When the election time is reset, it is a random value between 150 and 300ms.
[X] When a new election begins, the term is incremented by 1.
[ ] When a follower does get an AppendEntries message, it resets the election timer. (i.e. it doesn't start an election even after more than 300ms)
[X] Given an election begins, when the candidate gets a majority of votes, it becomes a leader. (think of the easy case; can use two tests for single and multi-node clusters)
[X] Given a candidate receives a majority of votes while waiting for unresponsive node, it still becomes a leader.
[X] A follower that has not voted and is in an earlier term responds to a RequestForVoteRPC with yes. (the reply will be a separate RPC)
[X] Given a candidate server that just became a candidate, it votes for itself.
[ ] Given a candidate, when it receives an AppendEntries message from a node with a later term, then candidate loses and becomes a follower.
[ ] Given a candidate, when it receives an AppendEntries message from a node with an equal term, then candidate loses and becomes a follower.
[X] If a node receives a second request for vote for the same term, it should respond no. (again, separate RPC for response)
[ ] If a node receives a second request for vote for a future term, it should vote for that node.
[X] Given a candidate, when an election timer expires inside of an election, a new election is started.
[ ] When a follower node receives an AppendEntries request, it sends a response.
[ ] Given a candidate receives an AppendEntries from a previous term, then rejects.
[ ] When a candidate wins an election, it immediately sends a heart beat.
